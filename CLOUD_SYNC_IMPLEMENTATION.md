# Cloud-First Sync and Sharing Feature Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of cloud-first sync and sharing features for the MyDictionary-English app using Firebase and Core Data.

## Overview

The implementation provides:
- **Private Dictionaries**: Synced via Core Data + iCloud for Apple devices
- **Shared Dictionaries**: Synced via Firebase Firestore for cross-platform collaboration
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can view/edit shared dictionaries
- **Offline Support**: Firestore offline persistence + Core Data caching
- **Conflict Resolution**: Timestamp-based conflict resolution

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Private Dictionary: Core Data ↔ iCloud ↔ Firestore
Shared Dictionary: Firestore ↔ Core Data (cache)
```

### Key Components

1. **Word Model** (`Shared/Services/Models/Word.swift`)
   - Codable struct for Firestore operations
   - Conversion methods to/from Core Data entities
   - Conflict resolution with timestamps

2. **DataSyncService** (`Shared/Services/DataSyncService.swift`)
   - Syncs private dictionaries between Core Data and Firestore
   - Handles offline writes and network reconnection
   - Batch operations for performance

3. **DictionaryService** (`Shared/Services/DictionaryService.swift`)
   - Manages shared dictionaries
   - Real-time listeners for collaboration
   - Cloud Functions integration for security

4. **Enhanced UI Components**
   - `AddSharedDictionaryView`: Create new shared dictionaries
   - `AddCollaboratorView`: Invite collaborators
   - `SharedDictionaryDetailsView`: Manage dictionary settings

## Firebase Setup

### 1. Firebase Project Configuration
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login and initialize
firebase login
firebase init
```

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
Deploy the rules from `firestore.rules`:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 3. Cloud Functions
Deploy the functions from `functions/index.js`:
```bash
cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Core Data Model Updates

### Added `isSynced` and `updatedAt` Attribute
The `CDWord` entity now includes:
```swift
@NSManaged var isSynced: Bool
@NSManaged var updatedAt: Date?
```

This tracks whether words have been synced to Firestore.

## Usage Guide

### For Users

#### 1. Sign In
- Use Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In
- Skip authentication for local-only mode

#### 2. Private Dictionaries
- Words are automatically synced to iCloud
- Also synced to Firestore for cross-platform access
- Works offline with local Core Data

#### 3. Shared Dictionaries
- Create shared dictionaries via the "+" menu
- Invite collaborators by email
- Real-time collaboration with role-based permissions

#### 4. Dictionary Management
- Switch between private and shared dictionaries
- Manage collaborators and permissions
- Delete dictionaries (owners only)

### For Developers

#### 1. Service Integration
```swift
// Add to your view
@EnvironmentObject var dictionaryService: DictionaryService
@EnvironmentObject var dataSyncService: DataSyncService
@EnvironmentObject var authenticationService: AuthenticationService
```

#### 2. Word Operations
```swift
// Add word to shared dictionary
dictionaryService.addWordToSharedDictionary(dictionaryId: "dict-id", word: word) { result in
    // Handle result
}

// Sync private dictionary
dataSyncService.syncPrivateDictionaryToFirestore(userId: userId) { result in
    // Handle result
}
```

#### 3. Real-time Listeners
```swift
// Listen to shared dictionary changes
dictionaryService.listenToSharedDictionaryWords(dictionaryId: "dict-id", context: context) { words in
    // Update UI with words
}
```

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication
- Google Sign-In integration
- Apple Sign-In support
- Anonymous access for local-only mode

### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access control (owner, editor, viewer)
- Firestore security rules enforcement
- Cloud Functions for secure operations

### 3. Data Protection
- Private dictionaries: User-only access
- Shared dictionaries: Collaborator-only access
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Network Issues
- Offline writes queued in Firestore
- Automatic retry on reconnection
- Core Data fallback for offline access
- **UI Feedback**: Visual indicators for sync status and offline mode

### 2. Conflict Resolution
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- **Field-level merging**: Preserves changes from multiple users
- **Array merging**: Intelligent merging of examples and tags
- **Smart updates**: Only updates changed fields

### 3. User Management
- Account switching with data migration
- User deletion cleanup
- Orphaned dictionary cleanup
- **Collaborator removal**: Secure removal via Cloud Functions

### 4. Performance
- Batch operations for large datasets
- Pagination for shared dictionaries
- Efficient Core Data queries
- **Listener management**: Automatic cleanup of inactive Firestore listeners

### 5. iCloud Integration
- **Sync monitoring**: Waits for iCloud sync completion before Firestore sync
- **Conflict prevention**: Prevents premature Firestore updates during iCloud sync

## Testing

### 1. Firebase Emulator
```bash
# Start emulator
firebase emulators:start

# Configure app for emulator
let settings = Firestore.firestore().settings
settings.host = "localhost:8080"
settings.isSSLEnabled = false
Firestore.firestore().settings = settings
```
