## ⭐ User Reviews

**4.8 out of 5 stars** • **75 Ratings** • **17 Reviews**

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Very useful app" - Hydrangia (UK)
*"I'm very pleased with this app. I can now key in words that I'm not familiar with and test myself with the quiz. So far everything in the app is working well and I'm enjoying it. It's great that it syncs as well as I have it on another device."*

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "FINALLY" - Branwiches (US)
*"I've been looking for something basic and simple like this for over a YEAR. Every app I tried had me swimming through ads on what basically looks like a web page pulled up in internet explorer just to use the bookmarking feature. This little My Dictionary app is SO easy to use and EXACTLY what I was looking for. Just a simple definition search engine that lets me save words. I also LOVE that it lets you enter in your own examples!! This has been so handy since I often forget where I initially read the word, so having a space to log the sentence I saw it in for context is SO INSANELY HELPFUL."*

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Amazing!" - Am0rdad (US)
*"Thank you for creating this. I searched a lot to find this perfection. But unfortunately after the latest update the 'get from the internet' has disappeared. Please bring it back. Update: it's all good now. Actually even better in this format. Thank you."*

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Just got it, already love it" - lovoxide (US)
*"I beg beg beg and plead, add compatibility between users. My friends and I are looking for a shared dictionary app, where we can all have our own dictionaries, and then a large combined overlapping one, the market has NONE. Please 🙏"*

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Great App" - TAdi47 (India)
*"Absolutely love this app. Great to build your vocabulary and practice the use of these words, apart from spelling and meaning another quiz could be added where you can practice the use of these words, no complains or qualms otherwise. Great job kudos to the team!! :)"*

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Finally an app exactly what I want" - _lynn！(US)
*"I'm looking for an app which can make my own quizzes for months. And I'm so happy to find the idioms section!! This little app definitely has everything for building your own dictionary! Best dictionary app ever."*

## 📖 The Story Behind My Dictionary

Four years ago, I was learning English and needed a better way to organize all the new words I encountered. Generic dictionaries didn't help me remember words, and word lists were too disorganized. I built My Dictionary to solve this: a powerful tool that lets you collect, organize, sort, and categorize vocabulary exactly how you need it.

Now the app helps thousands of people organize their vocabulary learning journey. The goal is simple: **stop collecting words you forget, and start organizing the ones that matter.**
