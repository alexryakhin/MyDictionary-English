    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Aleksandr Riakhin built the My Dictionary (English) app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Aleksandr Riakhin at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The data collected is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at My Dictionary (English) unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may collect **non-personal usage data** through Firebase Analytics. This includes anonymous app interaction events such as screen views, feature usage, and session duration.</p>
    <p>No personally identifiable information (such as names, emails, or precise locations) is collected. The data helps me improve app performance, identify issues, and optimize user experience.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>Whenever you use my Service, Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics may collect **anonymous log data** in case of errors. This Log Data may include information such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
        <li>App version and interaction events</li>
        <li>Crash reports and diagnostic data</li>
        <li>General usage patterns (e.g., most accessed features)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used solely for troubleshooting and improving app performance.</p>

    <h2>Opting Out of Analytics</h2>
    <p>If you prefer not to share analytics data, you can disable tracking by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turning off app tracking in your device’s **Settings > Privacy & Security**</li>
        <li>Using **Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) or opt-out settings (if applicable)**</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>This Service does not use cookies explicitly. However, Firebase may use cookies or device identifiers to analyze usage data. Users can manage cookie preferences in their device settings.</p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>While I do not employ third-party companies for data storage, I use **Google Firebase** for analytics and crash reporting. These services help improve app functionality while maintaining user privacy.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>I value your trust in providing us your information, and I use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If a child provides personal data, it is immediately removed.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy periodically. You are advised to review this page for changes.</p>
    <p>This policy is effective as of 2025-03-10.</p>
